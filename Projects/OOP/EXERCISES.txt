Basic Exercises

Class and Object Creation:
	Create a Person class with properties Name, Age, and Gender. Instantiate objects and set their properties.

Encapsulation:
	Create a BankAccount class with private fields for accountNumber, balance, and public methods to deposit and withdraw money.

Inheritance:
	Create a base class Animal with properties Name and Age, and a method MakeSound(). Create derived classes Dog and Cat that override the MakeSound() method.

Polymorphism:
	Create an interface IShape with a method CalculateArea(). Implement this interface in classes Circle and Rectangle. Use polymorphism to calculate areas of different shapes.

Abstraction:
	Create an abstract class Employee with properties Name and ID, and an abstract method CalculateSalary(). Derive classes FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that implement the abstract method.

Intermediate Exercises

Constructors and Destructors:
	Create a Car class with a parameterized constructor to initialize the carâ€™s make, model, and year. Include a destructor to display a message when an object is destroyed.

Method Overloading:
	Create a Calculator class with overloaded methods Add to add two integers, two doubles, and two strings.

Properties:
	Create a Product class with auto-implemented properties for ProductID, ProductName, and Price. Include a read-only property DiscountPrice that returns the price after a discount.

Static Members:
	Create a Student class with a static field TotalStudents to count the number of student objects created. Include a static method to display the total number of students.

Collections and Generics:
	Create a generic Repository<T> class with methods Add, Remove, and GetAll. Use this class to manage a collection of objects.
Advanced Exercises

Events and Delegates:
	Create a Publisher class that raises an event DataProcessed. Create a Subscriber class that handles this event.

LINQ Queries:
	Create a list of Employee objects and use LINQ queries to filter, sort, and select specific properties.

Exception Handling:
	Create a FileProcessor class with a method ReadFile that reads content from a file. Implement exception handling to manage file not found and read errors.

Design Patterns:
	Implement the Singleton pattern in a Logger class that ensures only one instance of the logger is created.

Dependency Injection:
	Create an application that demonstrates dependency injection using interfaces and concrete classes. Use a DI container like Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.

Practice Project

Simple Console Application:
	Build a console-based library management system. Implement classes like Book, Library, Member, and Loan. Include features like adding books, registering members, loaning books, and returning books.

Tips for Practicing

	Code Reviews: Regularly review and refactor your code to ensure it follows OOP principles and best practices.
	Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your classes and methods to ensure they work as expected.
	Documentation: Document your code with comments and XML documentation to make it easier to understand and maintain.
	
These exercises should help you build a strong foundation in C# and .NET OOP concepts.
